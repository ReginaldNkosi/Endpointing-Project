# Applications

- Noise reduction. VoIP, cellular etc.
- Text to speech.
- Speech to text.



## Noise reduction

Motivation

- Improving intelligibility
- Reducing listener fatigue

Can be formulated in different ways

- Speech enhancement
- Noise reduction
- Source separation


Stationary sources are well served by traditional DSP methods.
However complex non-stationary noise sources are not.
Machine learning, and especially deep learning, has shown great promise here.

Usually done by computing time-frequeny masks and applying them via spectral substraction.
